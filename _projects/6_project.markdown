American poet e.e. Cummings compiled a remarkable set of poems entitled “Tulips & Chimneys” in 1922. Originally published in 1923, only 66 of the 152 poems from the original manuscript were included and the title was altered to “Tulips and Chimneys”. Not until 1976 was the original manuscript from 1922 published in its entirety under Cummings’ intended name, “Tulips & Chimneys” by Liveright Publishing Corporation. Over the course of the fifty plus years that elapsed from the completion of the manuscript and its publication, many editions of the anthology were put into circulation under various titles. In my project, I aim to remediate Cummings’ original manuscript in the form of a series of Twitter accounts.
