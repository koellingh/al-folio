One known contributor to increased cancer risk is the level of expression of the p53 gene which produces proteins that assist in proofreading replicated genetic information during cell reproduction and terminate the cell when a mutation is detected. As important as the p53 gene is in stabilizing the body system from acquiring potentially harmful mutations, it requires a significant amount of activation energy. Our study aims to replicate this biological process to gain insight on the relationship between p53 gene expression and energy cost. We have built an adapted simulation from the Empirical Software that emulates this process by creating a world of organisms that are able to mutate their p53 gene expression rate. Specifically, we implemented our simulation by adjusting the rates of malignant and benign mutations, symbolic of cancerous and silent mutations, and rates of p53 gene expression. We enable these values to mutate over time and keep track of the average p53 gene expression rate among organisms in our simulation. After running 3500 simulations with varying starting p53 gene expression and malign and benign mutation rates, we observed that our organisms reached a lower equilibrium of average p53 rate when the amount of mutation rates, malignant or benign, were higher- a novel relationship between the p53 gene in cell behavior. Moving forward, we hope to improve our emulation of cancerous and silent mutations in cell replication to spotlight the relationship more effectively between overall cell mutation rates and p53 gene expression equilibrium.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>

    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/" target="_blank">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/6.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="{{ '/assets/img/11.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" title="example image"/>
    </div>
</div>
```
