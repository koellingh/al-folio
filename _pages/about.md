I'm Henry Koelling, a class of 2022 <a href="https://www.carleton.edu/computer-science/">Computer Science</a> major and<a href="https://www.carleton.edu/digital-arts-humanities/">Digital Arts and Humanities</a> minor at <a href="https://www.carleton.edu/">Carleton College</a>! I'm from Ann Arbor, Michigan, although I am currently located in Northfield, Minnesota. I am passionate about <a href="https://www.nature.com/subjects/computational-biology-and-bioinformatics">computational biology</a> with an emphasis on machine learning techniques in analyzing genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and digital humanities. This website aims to document my projects involving my academic endeavors in addition to providing general life updates. 

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing and watching soccer, engaging in contentious conversations, and making people laugh. Hope you enjoy! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to learn more about my projects!
